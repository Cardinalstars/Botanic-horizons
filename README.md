Botanic Horizons is an expert-style modpack integration for GT: New Horizons

# Dependencies

This mod depends on other mods that are part of the modpack. The `gradlew` scripts should handle getting them for you.

This project needs a Java 8 installation. Set `JAVA_HOME` to the appropriate value if this jdk is not available on `PATH`

The project can then be build with `./gradlew`, which will put the mod files in `build/libs`.
