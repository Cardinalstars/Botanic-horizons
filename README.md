Botanic Horizons is an expert-style modpack integration for GT: New Horizons

# Dependencies

This mod depends on other mods that are part of the modpack. Deobfuscated APIs for the following jars need to be added to the `libs/` folder:
- Botania (i.e. libs/botania-deobf.jar from https://github.com/combusterf/Botania-expert)
- Gregtech 5U (i.e. libs/gregtech-deobf.jar from https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/GT5-Unofficial)

This project needs a Java 8 installation. Set `JAVA_HOME` to the appropriate value if this jdk is not available on `PATH`

The project can then be build with `./gradlew`, which will put the mod files in `output/`
